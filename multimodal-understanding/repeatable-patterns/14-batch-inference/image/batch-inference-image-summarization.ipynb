    "# Bedrock Batch inference with Amazon Nova FMs for Image understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "With [Batch Inference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference.html), you can provide a set of prompts as a single input file and receive responses as a single output file, allowing you to get simultaneous large-scale predictions. The responses are processed and stored in your Amazon S3 bucket so you can access them at a later time. Amazon Bedrock offers support for Amazon Nova FMs for batch inference at a 50% lower price compared to on-demand inference pricing. Please refer to model list [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-supported.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Image summarization is a crucial task for businesses seeking to extract valuable insights. As the volume of images grows, traditional analysis methods struggle to keep pace, creating a demand for scalable solutions. Batch Inference for Amazon Bedrock provides a powerful tool to address this challenge by enabling organizations to process large volumes of data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage batch inference for summarizing images at scale by processing substantial volumes of images in batches. Though we are using example of image description here, you can really apply this to any other use case that does not need a real time output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:\n",
    "1. Updated boto3 to 1.35.1 or greater version\n",
    "2. You must have permissions to invoke `create_model_invocation_job` API. Refer to the documentation to learn about [required permissions for batch inference job](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-prereq.html#batch-inference-permissions).\n",
    "3. Permission to read and write data on Amazon S3 bucket.\n",
    "4. Bedrock Batch Inference requires a service role so that it can access and write to S3 on your behalf. You can create the service role manually [see here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-iam-sr.html) or use the AWS Console workflow which can create one for you [here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/home?region=us-east-1#/batch-inference/create). We also provide a quick way to create a service role in the code below.\n",
    "5. Ensure that you are in a AWS region that is supported for Batch Inference. Refer [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-supported.html) for documentation.\n",
    "6. The default maximum size of a single file (in GB) submitted for batch inference for Nova models is 1 GB. However, you can request an increase [here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/bedrock/quotas/L-68FC8D47) as needed.\n",

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before initiating a batch inference job for Image understanding, it's crucial to properly format and upload your data to an S3 bucket. Learn more about data format requirments in our [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/batch-inference-data.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The input data should be in JSONL format, with each line representing a single image for summarization. Each line in your JSONL file should follow this structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"recordId\": \"11 character alphanumeric string\", \"modelInput\": {JSON body}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `recordId` is an 11-character alphanumeric string, working as a unique identifier for each entry. If you omit this field, the batch inference job will automatically add it in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the `modelInput` JSON object should match the body field for the model you are using in the `InvokeModel` request. Since we are using the Amazon Nova Pro model on Amazon Bedrock, your model input might look like the following:\n",
