    "# Multi-Modal Multi-Agent AI Orchestrator (Amazon Bedrock & Nova)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project showcases a complex multi-modal, multi-agent workflow that leverages Amazon Bedrock features and the Nova foundation model to handle user queries with advanced reasoning, retrieval, and generative capabilities. It integrates multiple specialized agents (for routing, supervision, report writing, audio search, image search, etc.) that collaborate to answer questions by analyzing text, audio, and image data. The system dynamically plans workflows, uses memory for context, and can incorporate external information (web search, financial APIs, etc.) to produce a comprehensive response. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/agentic_orchestration.png\" width=\"950\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of the architecture include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Router Agent: Entry point that interprets the user query, accesses Agent Memory for relevant context, and decides on a plan (which agents/tools to invoke). It performs adaptive routing of requests based on query type and context (e.g. routing an audio-related question to the audio agent, invoking a web search for a timely data question, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "*  Supervisor Agent: Oversees the execution of the plan. It manages multi-agent collaboration, spawning or calling specialized agents as needed and sequencing their actions. The Supervisor collects results from each agent and handles the logic to merge these into a cohesive answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "*  Audio Search Agent: Specialized agent for audio content. It queries an Audio Knowledge Base to find information relevant to the user’s question from audio transcripts or audio files. Audio files (e.g. call recordings, podcasts) are ingested from an S3 bucket and processed through Bedrock Data Automation to generate transcripts and embeddings, which is indexed by Bedrock Knowledge Base. This is part of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, ensuring audio-derived facts can be included accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Image Search Agent: Specialized agent for image content. It works similarly to the audio agent but with an Image Knowledge Base. Images (e.g. diagrams, figures) are stored in S3 and analyzed by Bedrock Data Automation, which extracts metadata, tags, or captions (and possibly generates embeddings) from the images. \n",
    "\n",
    "*  Report Writer Agent: The Report Writer’s role is to synthesize a comprehensive report or answer for the user. The Report Writer Agent also invokes image generation if the final report would benefit from a visual (for example, creating a chart or diagram to illustrate a trend). Amazon Nova’s model family includes Nova Canvas for image generation , which is leveraged here as a Bedrock-provided tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this workflow, the LangGraph orchestration framework underpins the interactions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Creating agentic services with multi-agent capability using Amazon Bedrock, Converse API, and LangChain can be a powerful approach to building intelligent and collaborative systems. Amazon Bedrock provides a foundation for developing large language models (LLMs) and integrating them into applications, while the Converse API enables seamless communication between these models and external services. LangChain, on the other hand, offers a framework for building complex, multi-agent systems that can leverage the capabilities of various LLMs and other AI components. By combining these tools, developers can create agentic services that can engage in dynamic, context-aware interactions, share knowledge, and coordinate their efforts to tackle complex tasks. This approach can be particularly useful in scenarios where a diverse set of specialized agents need to collaborate, such as in enterprise automation, customer service, or research and development."

Set up the workflow graph with entry points, nodes, and edges to ensure a logical progression through the RAG agent's steps.

This system would consist of multiple intelligent agents, each with its own set of capabilities and knowledge, working together to achieve a common goal. The agents would use query-driven reasoning to understand the user's intent and then react accordingly, executing the necessary steps in the pipeline to provide the desired outcome. This approach allows for a more dynamic and adaptive system that can handle a wide range of tasks and respond to changing conditions in real-time. The result is a powerful and flexible service that can assist users with a variety of needs, from information retrieval to complex problem-solving."
